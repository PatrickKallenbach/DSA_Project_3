# DSA_Project_3
Project 3 - GeoCancer by Patrick Kallenbach, Nicholas Famiglietti, and Mia Burns

The UnityPlayer.dll found within the zip file is required to run the executable file. Place in the same folder as the executable.

The source code cannot run without the Unity project that the UI was built in. If you need to see the program running in the project, message Patrick on Canvas or through Slack.
